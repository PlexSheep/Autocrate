# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release is currently supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

It would be best if you reported any found security vulnerabilities on the GitHub mirror. 

If you want to send something encrypted, use [this](https://static.cscherr.de/keys/software@cscherr.de.asc) key.
You can always reach me on [software@cscherr.de](mailto:software@cscherr.de), but sadly, I'm struggeling with PGP
encryption in my mail client. I use protonmail to host my EMail services, so if you send me something from protonmail,
it will be end to end encrypted.
